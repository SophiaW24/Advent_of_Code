#part 2 of Day 2 is the same except:
#deleted part where numbers are compared to maximum values
#you just want min possible number of cube
#the code already saves the highest cube number of each game as red, green and blue
#thatÂ´s why we just need to multiply it in the loop, so each game will be already multiplied
#then the result will be added to sum so all multiplied numbers will be automatically added up
#see changes at line 12, 32, 33 -> rest is the same, only changed variable number in line 57 for context
